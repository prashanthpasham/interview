36.public class Demo
{

public static void test(){
   Sysout("static test");
}
 public void print(Object obj){
  Sysout("object called!");
}
public void print(String obj){
  Sysout("string called!");
}
main(..){
  Demo d = new Demo();
d.print(null);
//o/p:String print method called!

Demo demo =null;
demo.test(); // It will not throw null pointer exception because test() is static but for instance method throws nullpointerexception.

}
